6:T402,My girlfriend and I decided to move out of Vermont, to Colorado, so I was in need of a job. A good friend of ours got me in touch with a startup, Diesl.ai. Loving the idea of, and accepting the risks of, working for a startup. I jumped on board as soon as I could. Working for a startup gave me really quick exposure to the full breadth of the software solution thus far along with giving really good control over the solutions we developed. Unfortunately the company had to lay off all of its contract employees, otherwise I would be developing for them to this day. Diesl.ai allowed me views quite a bit deeper into the AI space along with many more modern workflows such as Kubernetes and cloud management via Azure. I was also responsible for the more complex AI solutions we were developing and was able to really press into topics and problems that are at the edge of current understanding and practices. I also worked quite a bit on our front end and backend solutions and maintained databases and pods on our clusters.7:Tfa3,This is by far my longest working role. I started my career as a production technician manufacturing computers. I significantly raised the bar in just about every positions I on the assembly line and proved myself as driven employee. I was quickly given more and more responsibility within the department and company as I became the first lead production technician. This essentially made me more directly responsible for the output of the assembly line and managing the various flex positions to ensure as smooth as a work flow as possible. I also started handling production readiness of any and all new products that were introduced. Creating new work instructions for the assembly line to follow along with maintaining/upgrading existing ones. After that I started creating software solutions, mainly on weekends, to increase velocity or quality within the assembly process. Tools such as part picking verification and BIOS flash drive automation. After this I was tasked with overhauling our product introduction process. At the time this was just a google sheet everyone edited and it made changes and KPI tracking difficult for our project managers. This was a full scale solo project on bare metal hardware that leveraged a PHP/MySQL/Vanilla JS setup to create a system for managing all of these parts. It also had built in functionality to allow users to associate custom tasks to products, product families, and component types. It also featured KPI tracking to better predict flow of products and identify bottlenecks. Shortly after this project I started developing a project that would automate testing interactions with computers using USB OTG support on raspberry PI's to automate tasks such as keyboard or mouse inputs. Unfortunately this never left the POC phase as I just did not have the capacity between nights and weekends to make a mature solution. Fortunately our IT team had a very similar project in the works, though it would take them years to actually deliver it due to competing company priorities. I did oversee the production readiness of this project to ensure that it was meeting the needs of our manufacturing team. Eventually I was given the Manufacturing Engineer title, first at the company, as I was just doing so many tasks beyond my scope as a technician that the company felt I deserved a more accurate title. With this also came more quality responsibilities that included managing quality KPI's, providing more customer support directly, and handling all production related improvements and corrective actions. This eventually extended, when our process engineer moved on from the company, to company wide process improvements and corrective actions. I also participated in customer technical calls and quality audits. I also traveled several times to our Netherlands office to assist in training the production team to better align practices between the two sites. All of these systems we managed on a multi-VM fallback setup with just about everything made in house to keep the latency as low as possible as seconds on the production line can cost a lot of money. With a couple offshoot IOT devices and compute machines for developing AI models. At this point I also started work with a co-worker as a indispensable collaborator developing full scale dev ops software for our production line. This included much more complex tools including dynamic travelers (something that travels with every system so that the techs know what steps are needed), Warehouse picking tools, Capacity management tools, Schedule capacity planning, Additional manufacturing tracking using NFC, AI Visions systems for accessory/picking verification. we were also responsible for the working condition and upgrades to the assembly line. The majority of our systems were either pneumatic or belt driven, so this required machining parts, purchasing off the shelf components, 3D printing where we could, and getting a bit creative with improvements that we could keep within budget. 0:{"P":null,"b":"86aUhQcpoLOf7-1NmgyUB","p":"","c":["",""],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/d20cbddc15b8a9d8.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"__variable_4d318d __variable_ea5f4b","children":["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}]}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"page_page__ZU32B","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"page_name_container__T3hUS","children":[["$","$L4",null,{"src":"/headshot_1.jpg","alt":"headshot","width":853,"height":1279,"layout":"responsive"}],["$","h1",null,{"children":"Nathan Laning"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"nlaning15@gmail.com"}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Software Developer"}],["$","a",null,{"href":"https://github.com/https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-laning-6b3a30b4/","children":"LinkedIn"}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","a",null,{"href":"https://github.com/NathanLaning","children":"GitHub"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"page_nav__zpG_3","children":[["$","$L5","Experience",{"style":{"textDecoration":"none"},"href":"/#Experience","passHref":true,"children":["$","h1","Experience",{"children":"Experience"}]}],["$","$L5","Resume",{"style":{"textDecoration":"none"},"href":"/#Resume","passHref":true,"children":["$","h1","Resume",{"children":"Resume"}]}],["$","$L5","Projects",{"style":{"textDecoration":"none"},"href":"/#Projects","passHref":true,"children":["$","h1","Projects",{"children":"Projects"}]}]]}]]}],["$","$L4",null,{"src":"/s_pano_4725_2.jpg","alt":"photo-mountains-switzerland-4725","width":4974,"height":1578,"className":"page_backdrop_photo__yNAb2"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"page_top_gradient_cover__5SGrX"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"page_content_container__dXA4m","children":[["$","div","Experience",{"id":"Experience","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"contents_contents__9_ZnX","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Experience"}],["$","h2",null,{"children":"Work Experience"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"contents_text_left_and_right__f9WUR","children":[["$","h3",null,{"children":"Software Engineer/AI Engineer"}],["$","h4",null,{"children":"Diesl.ai - October 2024 - March 2025"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"$6"}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Skills:"}],["$","ul",null,{"children":[["$","li",null,{"children":"Extensive python development, primarily creating AI solutions revolving around document comparison and document extraction.
